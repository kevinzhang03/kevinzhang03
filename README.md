# i'm kevin. i code and wish i can afford an xpan

I'm a second-year Computer Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. I really don't know what I'm doing sometimes, but that usually means I'm busy learning cool stuff.

You'll probably find me cooking tasty things, deranking in Valorant, ~~practicing my intrument,~~ crying, or shooting film in my free time!

- ðŸŒ± Learning lots and lots of React @_@
