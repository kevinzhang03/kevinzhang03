# i'm kevin. i code and wish i can afford an xpan

I'm a third-year Computer Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. I really don't know what I'm doing sometimes, but that usually means I'm busy learning cool stuff.

You'll probably find me cooking tasty things, deranking in Valorant, ~~practicing my intrument,~~ crying, or shooting film in my free time!

- ðŸ”­ Working my ass off trying to add blog support to my site
- ðŸŒ± Trying to relearn React and figure out how any of the code I wrote five months prior works
- ðŸ¤” Looking for help with scraping together the funds to buy an xpan
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about film photography. I will literally not shut up
- ðŸ“« You can go to my [amazing website](https://kevinistaking.pictures/) for my contact information
- âš¡ Fun fact: I've tried to fix four film cameras and far I have a 100% lose rate!! B)
