# i'm kevin. i code and wish i can afford an xpan

I'm a third-year Computer Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. I really don't know what I'm doing sometimes, but that usually means I'm busy learning cool stuff.

You'll probably find me cooking tasty things, deranking in Valorant, ~~practicing my intrument,~~ or shooting film in my free time!

- ðŸ”­ Migrating my entire site to I can avoid later technical debt...
- ðŸ¤” Looking for help with scraping together the funds to buy an xpan
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about film photography. I will literally not shut up
- ðŸ“« You can go to my [amazing website](https://kevinistaking.pictures/) for my contact information
